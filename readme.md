# Builder for Dieharder 3.31.1.4

Since this historic piece of software seems to peek the interest, I made it my mission to make it available to non developers, since it is no longer available on brew.

This is a simple shell script that should download, compile and install dieharder on macos/aarch64.

Just execute the script and follow the instructions.
